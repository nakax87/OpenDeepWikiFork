## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Intelligent Repository Discovery
**Primary Detection Logic:**
1. **Language Identification** - Analyze file extensions, content patterns, and project structure
2. **Framework Detection** - Identify signatures from config files, dependencies, and code patterns
3. **Architecture Mapping** - Determine architectural style (MVC, microservices, component-based, etc.)
4. **Dependency Analysis** - Map relationships between modules, components, and external services

### Phase 2: Adaptive Framework Analysis
**Framework-Specific Logic:**

**Frontend Frameworks:**
- **React/Next.js** → Component hierarchies, hooks, state management, routing patterns
- **Vue/Nuxt.js** → Component composition, store patterns, reactive data flow
- **Angular** → Module structure, services, dependency injection, lifecycle management
- **Svelte/SvelteKit** → Reactive patterns, stores, compilation strategies

**Backend Frameworks:**
- **Node.js (Express/Fastify)** → Middleware chains, route organization, error handling
- **Python (Django/Flask)** → View patterns, ORM usage, middleware architecture
- **Java (Spring)** → Bean management, auto-configuration, enterprise patterns
- **PHP (Laravel/Symfony)** → Service containers, eloquent patterns, middleware

**Full-Stack Solutions:**
- **Next.js/Nuxt.js** → SSR/SSG strategies, API routes, data fetching patterns
- **SvelteKit** → Server-side rendering, form actions, load functions

### Phase 3: Documentation Intelligence
**Analysis Dimensions:**
1. **Architectural Patterns** - Design patterns, separation of concerns, modularity
2. **Data Flow** - State management, database integration, caching strategies
3. **Integration Points** - APIs, external services, authentication flows
4. **Performance Characteristics** - Optimization patterns, bottlenecks, scaling considerations
