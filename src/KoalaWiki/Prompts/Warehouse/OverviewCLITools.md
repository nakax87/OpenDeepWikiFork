## CLI Tool Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: CLI Tool Identification & Classification
**Tool Type Detection:**
1. **Utility Tool**: Single-purpose command with focused functionality
2. **Multi-Command Tool**: Complex CLI with subcommands and varied operations
3. **Pipeline Tool**: Designed for data transformation and command chaining
4. **Development Tool**: Developer-focused with build, test, or deployment features
5. **System Tool**: System administration or configuration management
6. **Interactive Tool**: TUI (Text User Interface) or interactive command modes

**Core Functionality Analysis:**
- Extract primary commands from source code, help files, or argument parsers
- Identify command hierarchy and subcommand structure
- Map input/output patterns and data flow
- Analyze configuration options and environment variables
- Discover integration points with other tools and systems

### Phase 2: Command Structure Analysis
**Command Pattern Recognition:**
- **Global Options**: Flags available across all commands
- **Subcommands**: Individual command functions and their specific options
- **Argument Patterns**: Required vs optional arguments, variadic inputs
- **Input Sources**: File inputs, stdin, environment variables, config files
- **Output Formats**: JSON, YAML, plain text, structured data, logging

**Usage Context Discovery:**
- **Standalone Usage**: Direct command execution scenarios
- **Pipeline Integration**: How the tool fits in command chains
- **Automation Scripts**: Batch processing and scripting use cases
- **CI/CD Integration**: Build pipeline and deployment workflows
- **Developer Workflows**: Integration with development processes

### Phase 3: User Experience Analysis
**Installation & Setup Assessment:**
- **Distribution Methods**: Package managers, direct downloads, container images
- **System Requirements**: OS compatibility, dependencies, prerequisites
- **Configuration Needs**: Config files, environment setup, first-run setup
- **Global vs Local Installation**: System-wide vs project-specific installation

**Learning Curve & Discoverability:**
- **Help System Quality**: Built-in help, man pages, documentation completeness
- **Command Discoverability**: How users find and learn commands
- **Error Handling**: Error messages quality and helpful guidance
- **Progressive Complexity**: Basic to advanced usage patterns

### CLI-Specific Content Generation Rules

**Command Documentation Standards:**
```
For each command found:
- Syntax: tool [global-options] command [command-options] [arguments]
- Description: What the command does (extracted from help/docs)
- Examples: Real usage examples (from tests/docs/source)
- Options: All available flags and parameters
- Exit codes: Success/failure codes if documented
```

**Installation Section Optimization:**
```
Priority order for installation methods:
1. Package manager (npm, pip, cargo, go install, etc.)
2. Direct binary download
3. Container/Docker usage
4. Source compilation
5. Platform-specific installers
```

**Usage Examples Framework:**
```
Example categories to include (if data available):
1. Basic usage - simplest form
2. Common workflows - typical use cases
3. Advanced usage - complex scenarios
4. Integration examples - with other tools
