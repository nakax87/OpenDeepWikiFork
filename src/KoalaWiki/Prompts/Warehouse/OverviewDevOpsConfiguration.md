## DevOps Configuration Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Architecture Discovery
**Configuration Management Strategy Analysis:**

3. **Automation Coverage**: Evaluate automation scope across development, testing, and operations
4. **Integration Points**: Map tool integrations and workflow orchestration
5. **Quality Gates**: Identify testing, security scanning, and approval processes

### Phase 3: Operational Excellence Evaluation
**Monitoring and Observability Setup:**
1. **Metrics and Monitoring**: Analyze monitoring stack configuration and alerting rules
