## Analysis Framework

<analysis_instructions>
Execute this analysis in the following order, being thorough and methodical:

1. **Repository Deep Dive**
- Map the complete CLI command structure and hierarchy
- Identify all entry points, argument parsers, and command handlers
- Document option interdependencies and validation logic
- Analyze error handling patterns and exit codes

2. **User Experience Mapping**
- Trace typical user workflows from simple to complex scenarios
- Identify common pain points and error conditions
- Document shell integration opportunities and best practices
- Map input/output patterns and data flow

3. **Technical Architecture Analysis**
- Document command execution flow and internal architecture
- Identify performance considerations and optimization opportunities
- Analyze cross-platform compatibility and environment requirements
- Map configuration systems and extensibility points

4. **Documentation Synthesis**
- Create progressive learning paths from beginner to expert usage
- Design comprehensive reference materials with searchable structure
- Include real-world examples and troubleshooting scenarios
- Develop visual representations of complex relationships
  </analysis_instructions>

## Required Documentation Components

<documentation_structure>
Your final documentation must include ALL of these sections:

### 1. Executive Overview
- Clear value proposition and primary use cases
- Installation requirements and compatibility matrix
- Quick-start guide with first successful command

### 2. Command Reference System
- Complete command hierarchy with syntax definitions
- Comprehensive option matrix with defaults and validation rules
- Interactive examples progressing from basic to advanced
- Copy-paste ready code blocks with explanations

### 3. Visual Architecture Maps
Create Mermaid diagrams for:
- Command structure and relationships
- Data flow and processing pipelines
- User interaction sequences
- Error handling and recovery paths

### 4. Advanced Usage Patterns
- Shell integration and completion setup
- Configuration management and customization
- Performance optimization techniques
- Automation and scripting examples

### 5. Troubleshooting & Operations
- Common error scenarios with specific solutions
- Debug techniques and diagnostic commands
- Version-specific behavior differences
- Cross-platform considerations and workarounds

</output_specifications>

## Quality Standards & Best Practices

<quality_requirements>
- **Accuracy**: Verify all commands, options, and examples against actual source code
- **Completeness**: Cover 100% of available commands and major use cases
- **Usability**: Include copy-paste ready examples that actually work
- **Visual Clarity**: Use Mermaid diagrams to illustrate complex relationships
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Structure content from basic concepts to advanced techniques
- **Cross-Platform**: Document platform-specific differences and requirements
- **Maintenance**: Include version information and update procedures
  </quality_requirements>

## Example Excellence Standards

<example_patterns>
For each command, provide:

```bash
# Basic usage with explanation
command --option value  # What this does and when to use it

# Real-world scenario
command --advanced-option --flag input.txt  # Specific use case explanation

# Common variations
command -o value  # Short form explanation
command --option=value  # Alternative syntax
```

Include error examples:
```bash
# This will fail because...
command --invalid-combo  # Error: explanation of why this fails
# Solution: correct approach
command --proper-option  # This works because...
```
</example_patterns>

## Performance Instructions

<execution_guidelines>
- Reference source code directly with specific file paths and line numbers
- Create comprehensive visual diagrams for complex command relationships
- Include working examples for every documented feature
- Test all command syntax against the actual repository
- Document exit codes, error messages, and recovery procedures
- Provide shell completion scripts where applicable
- Don't hold back - create the most comprehensive CLI documentation possible
- Include as many relevant features, examples, and edge cases as you can identify
- Go beyond basic documentation to create a truly exceptional reference resource
  </execution_guidelines>

## Technical Citation Format

<citation_requirements>
When referencing source code, use this format:
- Direct file references: `[filename.ext]({{$git_repository}}/blob/branch/path/to/file#L123-L145)`
- Command implementations: Link to specific functions/methods that handle each command
- Configuration examples: Reference actual config files in the repository
- Error handling: Link to error message definitions and handling code
  </citation_requirements>

Begin your analysis immediately and create documentation that sets the gold standard for CLI tool reference materials.
