## Step 1: DevOps Toolchain & Infrastructure Detection
<analysis_instruction>
First, analyze the repository structure to identify:
- Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Ansible)
- Containerization patterns (Docker, Kubernetes, Docker Compose)
- CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, multi-cloud setups)
- Configuration management tools (Helm, Kustomize, Chef, Puppet)
- Monitoring and observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, APM tools)
  </analysis_instruction>

## Step 2: DevOps-Specific Analysis Logic
<conditional_logic>
IF repository contains primarily:
- **Terraform/HCL**: Focus on resource provisioning, state management, module structure, and provider configurations
- **Kubernetes/YAML**: Emphasize workload definitions, networking, security policies, and resource management
- **Docker**: Analyze containerization strategies, multi-stage builds, security scanning, and image optimization
- **CI/CD Configurations**: Focus on pipeline stages, deployment strategies, secret management, and automation workflows
- **Ansible/Playbooks**: Emphasize configuration management, inventory patterns, and automation tasks
- **Helm Charts**: Analyze templating patterns, value management, and release strategies
- **Monitoring Configs**: Focus on alerting rules, dashboards, and observability patterns
- **Cloud Formation/ARM**: Analyze stack definitions, parameter management, and deployment patterns

FOR mixed DevOps repositories:
- Identify the primary infrastructure platform
- Map integration patterns between tools
- Document deployment pipeline orchestration
  </conditional_logic>

## Step 3: Progressive DevOps Analysis Deep-Dive
<thinking_process>
For each identified component, think step-by-step:
1. What infrastructure or process does this component manage?
2. How does it integrate with other DevOps tools in the pipeline?
3. What security and compliance measures are implemented?
4. What are the scalability and reliability patterns?
5. How does this fit into the overall deployment strategy?
6. What are potential optimization or improvement areas for efficiency and security?
   </thinking_process>
   </reasoning_framework>

<analysis_protocol>
## Phase 1: Intelligent DevOps Repository Scanning
<scan_instructions>
Execute comprehensive DevOps analysis with adaptive logic:
- Identify IaC files and infrastructure patterns
- Detect containerization strategies and orchestration configs
- Map CI/CD pipeline definitions and deployment workflows
- Identify monitoring, logging, and alerting configurations
- Detect security scanning and compliance tools
- Analyze environment configuration and secret management
  </scan_instructions>

## Phase 2: DevOps-Adaptive Documentation
<framework_adaptation>
Implement specialized analysis based on detected DevOps tools:

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Module structure, provider configurations, state management, workspace patterns
- **CloudFormation**: Stack organization, parameter management, nested stacks, cross-stack references
- **Pulumi**: Resource definitions, stack configurations, policy as code
- **Ansible**: Playbook organization, inventory management, role structures, vault usage

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Deployment strategies, service mesh integration, RBAC, network policies
- **Docker Compose**: Service definitions, networking, volume management, scaling patterns
- **Helm**: Chart structure, templating patterns, release management, value hierarchies

### CI/CD Platforms
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow definitions, reusable actions, secret management, matrix strategies
- **GitLab CI**: Pipeline configurations, stages, artifacts, deployment environments
- **Jenkins**: Pipeline as code, shared libraries, build agents, plugin ecosystems
- **Azure DevOps**: YAML pipelines, task groups, variable groups, deployment gates

### Cloud Platforms
- **AWS**: Service configurations, IAM policies, VPC patterns, auto-scaling groups
- **Azure**: Resource groups, ARM templates, managed identities, networking
- **GCP**: Project organization, IAM bindings, networking, GKE configurations
  </framework_adaptation>

## Phase 3: Multi-Dimensional DevOps Analysis
<analysis_dimensions>
For each critical DevOps component, analyze:

### Infrastructure Patterns
