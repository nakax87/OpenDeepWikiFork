- Terminal-focused

### classifyName:DevOpsConfiguration
**Definition**: Deployment, operations, and configuration related projects
- CI/CD Tools and configurations
- Containerization and orchestration
- Monitoring and operations tools
- Configuration files and best practices

**Key Indicators**:
- Serve deployment and operations
- Configuration and script-heavy
- Automated workflows
- Infrastructure-focused

### classifyName:Documentation
**Definition**: Documentation, educational resources, and knowledge repositories
- Technical Documentation (API docs, Guides, Tutorials)
- Educational Projects (Learning resources, Courses, Examples)
- Specification Documents (Standards, Protocols, RFCs)
- Knowledge Repositories (Awesome lists, Curated collections)

**Key Indicators**:
- Primarily markdown, text, or static site files
- Educational or reference purpose
- Minimal executable code
- Knowledge-sharing focused

# ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

## Structure Analysis
1. Examine directory patterns (src/, app/, lib/, tools/, bin/, .github/, docs/, examples/)
2. Review configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, CI configs)
3. Identify technology stack (programming languages, frameworks, build tools)
4. Locate entry points (main files, executables, documentation entry points)
5. Assess code-to-documentation ratio

## Documentation Analysis
1. Extract core purpose and stated objectives from project description
2. Identify usage patterns (how the project is used/integrated/consumed)
3. Determine target audience (developers, end-users, learners, operators)
4. Analyze classification-relevant keywords and terminology
5. Evaluate installation/setup instructions complexity
6. Review provided examples and demonstrations

## Multi-dimensional Scoring
Score each category based on weighted evidence:
- Primary Indicators (40%): Core structure, entry points, file types
- Configuration Analysis (25%): Package files, build configs, deployment settings
- Documentation Content (20%): README analysis, stated purpose, usage examples
- Technology Dependencies (10%): Framework dependencies, tool requirements
- Usage Context (5%): Installation method, integration patterns

## Decision Logic
1. Calculate scores for each category based on evidence
2. Select the category with the highest confidence score
3. Verify consistency across multiple analysis dimensions
4. Consider project maturity, scale, and ecosystem position
