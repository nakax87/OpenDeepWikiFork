<reasoning_framework>
## Step 1: Repository Language & Framework Detection
<analysis_instruction>
First, analyze the repository structure to identify:
- Primary programming languages (based on file extensions and content)
- Framework patterns (React, Vue, Angular, Django, Flask, Spring, etc.)
- Architecture patterns (MVC, microservices, monolith, etc.)
- Build systems and toolchains
  </analysis_instruction>

## Step 2: Language-Specific Analysis Logic
<conditional_logic>
IF repository contains primarily:
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Focus on component hierarchies, state management, bundling, and modern JS patterns
- **Python**: Emphasize module structure, data processing pipelines, API frameworks, and package management
- **Java**: Analyze class hierarchies, design patterns, Spring ecosystem, and enterprise patterns
- **C#/.NET**: Focus on namespace organization, dependency injection, and .NET ecosystem
- **Go**: Emphasize package structure, goroutines, and microservice patterns
- **Rust**: Analyze ownership patterns, crate organization, and memory safety
- **PHP**: Focus on composer dependencies, MVC patterns, and web architecture
- **Other languages**: Adapt analysis to language-specific conventions and patterns

FOR mixed-language repositories:
- Identify the primary application language
- Map inter-language communication patterns
- Document build pipeline integration
  </conditional_logic>

## Step 3: Progressive Analysis Deep-Dive
<thinking_process>
For each identified component, think step-by-step:
1. What is the component's primary responsibility?
2. How does it interact with other components?
3. What data flows through this component?
4. What are the key design patterns used?
5. How does this fit into the overall architecture?
6. What are potential optimization or improvement areas?
   </thinking_process>
   </reasoning_framework>

<analysis_protocol>
## Phase 1: Intelligent Repository Scanning
<scan_instructions>
Execute comprehensive repository analysis with adaptive logic:
- Identify file patterns and project structure
- Detect framework signatures and configuration files
- Map dependency relationships and imports
- Identify entry points and main execution flows
- Detect testing patterns and strategies
- Analyze deployment and build configurations
  </scan_instructions>

## Phase 2: Framework-Adaptive Documentation
<framework_adaptation>
Implement specialized analysis based on detected frameworks:

### Frontend Frameworks
- **React/Next.js**: Component tree, hooks usage, state management (Redux/Zustand), routing
- **Vue/Nuxt.js**: Component composition, Vuex/Pinia patterns, directive usage
- **Angular**: Module structure, services, dependency injection, lifecycle hooks
- **Svelte/SvelteKit**: Reactive patterns, store usage, component compilation

### Backend Frameworks
- **Express.js/Fastify**: Middleware chains, route handlers, error handling
- **Django/Flask**: View patterns, ORM usage, middleware, template systems
- **Spring Boot**: Bean management, auto-configuration, aspect-oriented programming
- **Laravel/Symfony**: Service containers, eloquent patterns, middleware

### Full-Stack Frameworks
- **Next.js/Nuxt.js**: SSR/SSG patterns, API routes, data fetching strategies
- **SvelteKit**: Server-side rendering, form actions, load functions
  </framework_adaptation>

## Phase 3: Multi-Dimensional Technical Analysis
<analysis_dimensions>
For each critical system component, analyze:

### Architecture Patterns
- Design pattern implementation (Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.)
- Architectural style (MVC, MVP, MVVM, Clean Architecture)
- Dependency management and inversion of control
- Separation of concerns and modularity

### Data & State Management
- Data structure definitions and relationships
- State management patterns and flows
- Database integration and ORM usage
- Caching strategies and implementation

### Integration & Communication
- API design and implementation patterns
- Inter-service communication (if microservices)
- External service integrations
- Authentication and authorization flows

### Performance & Optimization
- Bundling and code splitting strategies
- Lazy loading implementations
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Optimization opportunities and bottlenecks
  </analysis_dimensions>
