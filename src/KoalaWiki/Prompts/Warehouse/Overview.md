## Data Extraction & Validation Protocol

### Phase 1: Data Discovery
**Primary Data Analysis:**
1. **Technology Stack Identification**: Extract programming languages, frameworks, and tools from project structure and package files
2. **Project Type Classification**: Determine if it's a library, application, framework, tool, or service based on structure
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identify features from source code, documentation, and configuration files
4. **Architecture Pattern Recognition**: Analyze source code structure to understand architectural patterns
5. **Dependency Mapping**: Extract dependencies from package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

### Phase 2: Content Validation
**Data Availability Checks:**
- Verify which data sources contain actual content
- Identify missing or incomplete data sections
- Map available information to documentation sections
- Determine content depth based on available data richness

### Phase 3: Adaptive Documentation Strategy
**Content Generation Rules:**
- **Rich Data Available**: Generate comprehensive sections with detailed examples
- **Partial Data Available**: Create focused sections with available information
- **No Data Available**: Skip section entirely or provide minimal placeholder
- **Inferred Information**: Clearly mark assumptions based on project structure patterns

## Advanced Analysis Framework

- Analyze error handling patterns from source code
- Review logging and monitoring setup from configuration files
- Assess documentation coverage from available docs and inline comments
- Examine security practices from dependency management and configuration

### 3. Developer Experience Optimization (Evidence-Based)
**Onboarding Analysis:**
- Extract installation procedures from README and documentation
- Identify learning resources from documentation files
- Analyze example quality from test files and documentation
- Review troubleshooting resources from issue templates and docs
- Evaluate development setup from contributing guides and scripts

**Community Integration:**
- Extract contribution guidelines from available files
- Analyze governance model from documentation and repository structure
- Review community health files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- Identify maintainer information from package files and documentation
- Assess internationalization support from project structure

### 4. Business & Sustainability Analysis (File-Based Evidence)
**Project Health Indicators:**
- Analyze maintainer diversity from commit history and package info
- Extract funding information from documentation and package files
- Review governance documentation for decision-making processes
- Identify sustainability strategies from documentation
- Map long-term roadmap from available planning documents

## Adaptive Documentation Structure

### Dynamic Content Generation Rules

**Section Inclusion Logic:**
```
IF project_type == "library" THEN
  Focus on: Installation, API Reference, Integration Examples
ELSE IF project_type == "application" THEN  
  Focus on: Installation, Usage Guide, Configuration
ELSE IF project_type == "framework" THEN
  Focus on: Getting Started, Architecture, Plugin Development
ELSE IF project_type == "tool" THEN
  Focus on: Installation, Commands, Configuration
```

**Content Depth Scaling:**
```
IF rich_documentation_available THEN
  Generate comprehensive sections with extracted examples
ELSE IF basic_readme_exists THEN
  Create focused overview with available information  
ELSE IF only_code_available THEN
  Infer functionality from code structure and generate minimal docs
```
