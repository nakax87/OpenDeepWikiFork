## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Create a documentation structure specifically tailored to this project, based on careful analysis of the provided code, README, and other project materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers.

## ANALYSIS PROCESS
1. Thoroughly examine all provided code files, focusing on:
  - Main components and their relationships
  - Service architecture and dependencies
  - API endpoints and interfaces
  - Configuration options and customization points
  - Core functionality and features
  - Project organization patterns

2. Identify documentation needs for different user types:
  - New users requiring onboarding and getting started guides
  - Developers needing implementation details
  - Advanced users seeking customization options
  - API consumers requiring interface specifications

## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
1. Create a hierarchical structure that mirrors the project's logical organization
2. Use terminology consistent with the project's codebase
3. Include only sections that correspond to actual components, services, and features
4. Cover every significant aspect without omission
5. Organize content to create a clear learning path from basic to advanced topics
6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation
7. For documentation sites specifically:
  - Ensure navigation is intuitive and follows standard documentation patterns
  - Group related topics logically to minimize navigation complexity
  - Structure API documentation for maximum searchability and reference value

## SECTION TYPES TO INCLUDE
1. Getting Started
  - Installation instructions
  - Basic configuration
  - Quick start examples
  - Prerequisites and dependencies

2. Core Concepts
  - Fundamental architecture
  - Key terminology
  - Design principles
  - Component overview

3. Feature Documentation
  - Detailed explanation of each major feature
  - Configuration options
  - Usage examples
  - Best practices

4. API Reference
  - Complete interface documentation
  - Parameters and return values
  - Authentication methods
  - Error handling

5. Advanced Topics
  - Customization options
  - Extension points
  - Performance optimization
  - Integration with other systems

6. Troubleshooting
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Debugging techniques
  - Error message explanations
  - Support resources

Insert your input content between the <documentation_structure></documentation_structure> tags as follows:

<documentation_structure>
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "section-identifier",
      "name": "Section Name",
      "prompt": "Create comprehensive content for this section focused on [SPECIFIC PROJECT COMPONENT/FEATURE]. Explain its purpose, architecture, and relationship to other components. Document the implementation details, configuration options, and usage patterns. Include both conceptual overviews for beginners and technical details for experienced developers. Use terminology consistent with the codebase. Provide practical examples demonstrating common use cases. Document public interfaces, parameters, and return values. Include diagrams where appropriate to illustrate key concepts.",
      "children": [
        {
          "title": "subsection-identifier",
          "name": "Subsection Name",
          "prompt": "Develop detailed content for this subsection covering [SPECIFIC ASPECT OF PARENT COMPONENT]. Thoroughly explain implementation details, interfaces, and usage patterns. Include concrete examples from the actual codebase. Document configuration options, parameters, and return values. Explain relationships with other components. Address common issues and their solutions. Make content accessible to beginners while providing sufficient technical depth for experienced developers."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
</documentation_structure>

## DOCUMENTATION-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES
1. For technical documentation, prioritize accuracy and completeness over brevity
2. Structure API documentation to follow standard patterns (OpenAPI, JSDoc, etc.) if applicable
3. Include code examples that demonstrate actual usage patterns from the codebase
4. For each section, identify the most relevant source files that provide implementation details
5. Ensure documentation sections align with the project's actual architecture, not idealized versions
6. Create documentation that would be immediately useful for both new contributors and users
7. For open-source projects, include contribution guidelines and development setup instructions
8. For complex systems, provide architectural diagrams and component relationship explanations
9. Include version compatibility information where applicable
10. Ensure documentation structure supports future expansion as the project evolves

## QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKLIST
Before finalizing your output:
- Verify all major components are represented in the documentation structure
- Confirm terminology matches the actual codebase
- Check that the structure follows a logical progression from basic to advanced topics
- Validate that API documentation sections cover all public interfaces
- Confirm the structure addresses both conceptual understanding and practical usage
